# Gaussian Mixture Model
This project propose a study on the scalability of the Gaussian Mixture Model, an unsupervised machine learning technique.
It's a probability-based clustering technique that we explored in different versions: sequential, parallel and distributed.
In particular, in the code we report our distributed version, Mllib GMM version, SGD GMM.

# Tools
All the versions are written in Scala 2.12.10, while for distributed versions we use Spark 3.1.3.
Cloud computing is performed with Google Cloud Platform, using Google Cloud Storage and Google Dataproc.
